# 3D Printed Polarimetry Components

This project uses 3D printing and computer-aided design to create cost-effective components for polarisation experiments, including a polariser, analyser, photodiode mount, LED mount, and sample tube holder.

## Abstract

Leveraging 3D printing, we crafted precision components for polarisation experiments. These components were integral in verifying Malus' law, gauging chiral material optical activity, and measuring birefringence. Notably, the sample tube holder enabled polarimetry tests on diverse substances.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Customize the OpenSCAD code to your experiment's needs.
3. Generate 3D models using OpenSCAD.
4. 3D print the models.
5. Assemble components per design.
6. Conduct polarimetry experiments as described in the abstract.
